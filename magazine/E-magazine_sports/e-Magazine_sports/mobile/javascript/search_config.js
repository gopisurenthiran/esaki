Pramahamsa)                                 A certain traveler came to a large plain in the course of his travels. As he had been walking in the sun for many hours, he was thoroughly exhausted and heavily perspiring; so he sat down in the shade of a tree to rest a little. Presently he began to think what a comfort it would be if he could but get a soft bed there to sleep on. He was not aware that he was sitting under the celestial tree. As soon as the above thought rose in his mind, he found a nice bed by his side. He felt much astonished, but all the same stretched himself on it. Now he thought to himself, how pleasant it would be, were a young damsel to come there and gently stroke his legs. No sooner did the thought arise in his mind than he found a young damsel sitting at his feet and stroking his legs. The traveler felt supremely happy. Presently he felt hungry and thought: \"I have got whatever I have wished for; could I not then get some food?\" Instantly he found various kinds of delicious food spread before him. He at once fell to eating, and having helped himself to his heart’s content, stretched himself again on his bed. He now began to revolve in his mind the events of the day. While thus occupied, he thought: \"If a tiger should attack me all of a sudden!\" In an instant a large tiger jumped on him and broke his neck and began to eat him. In this way the traveler lost his life. But, REMEMBER, there is the dread of the tiger behind the gifts you get.  BEST WISHES!  S.
